# gnomenwald
In the country of GnomenWald there lie many isolated villages connected by roads (roads only ever go from village to village, never going nowhere nor branching out partway). The gnomes are very organised, so although they name their villages in the Gnomic language, all their villages have unique integer ids, starting incrementally from "1". In the days of the Grand Archgnome Zijphraagh, a complete road map was made of GnomenWald -- some of the gnomes were surprised to see that some villages had many roads connecting to them, whereas some had only two, or even only one. They also noticed that some of the roads were only one-way (often due to the rigours of the terrain, but sometimes due to political sensitivities), so the map-makers were very careful to label all their roads as one-way (so that a two-way road between two villages would be drawn as a pair of one-way roads in each direction). After several generations the population had increased so much that new villages started to spring up (though always connected via a road or roads to one or more villages in GnomenWald), and sometimes villages would disappear (though that made it very hard for the mapmakers since they insisted that roads only joined villages and never branched in the middle). A data structure and GUI are built to display this.
